# bcall_1_file_1_block_multi_event



This bcall file processes 1 .bin file at a time. During the calculation in GPU, it uses 1 block of threads. CPU calls the kernel
for 32 events. 

For an example, the data contains strand#0 and strand#1. And each strand includes two sets of pore model. So we will have 4 
groups of data: 1. strand#0, pore model#0, 2.strand#0, pore model#1, 3.strand#1, pore model#0 and 4.strand#1, pore model#1. 
We need to apply viterbi algorithm or calculate the probability for all these 4 sets of data. Lets call these 4 groups of data 
as DATASET# 0, 1, 2 and 3. 

The following pseudo code shows how the DATASETs are processed:

      for loop: DATASET 0 to 3

            for loop: i=1 to number_of_events; i=i+32
      
                  send data from cpu to GPU
              
                  kernel_call<<<1 block, 1024 threads/block>>>();
              
                  recieve data from GPU to CPU
              
            end
      
      end 



In the kernel call, I am using only 1024 threads. but the number of states is 4096. I have used loop  (for 4 times) so that 
1024 threads will calculated 4096 states. The pseudo code for the kernel call is given below:

      
      for loop: n=0 to 31; n++   //multiple events
      
            for loop: i=0 to 3; i++

                  calculated transition probability
        
                  calculated emission probability
        
                  update alpha
        
            end

            find the maximum emission probability
            
            update summation of maximum probability
            
      end

To change the number of threads per block or iteration, change the values from "Predefined_values.cuh" 


//***************************************************

To export the path(if you have not done yet):

      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
      export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}

To run the file from terminal:

      $ nvcc bcall_1_block_multi_event.cu -use_fast_math -Xptxas -v -arch=sm_30 -lcurand 

I have used -arch=sm_30 because the compute capability of my GPU is 3.0. check yours one. 

then

      $./a.out
